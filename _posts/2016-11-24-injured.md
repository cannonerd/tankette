I knew it would happen at some point, but I hoped it would not be so soon. I have a strained calf and need to stay off skates for 2-4 weeks. How annoying!

I plan to use this time to work on my core strength. I have been slacking on that department for a while now and the training pause means that at least now I have the time to do that.  
So I hope in a bit I'm back, better than ever.
